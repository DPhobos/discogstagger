== What ==

DiscogsTagger is a console based audio meta-data tagger. Artist profile data is 
retrieved via the discogs.com API.

Simply provide the script with a destination directory name, that contains an
album consisting of either FLAC or MP3 media files, and the discogs.com 
release-id. DiscogsTagger calls out to the discogs.com API and updates the
audio meta-data accordingly.

During the process, all album images (if present) are retrieved from the API. 
As well, a play-list (.m3u) and an information file (.nfo) are generated per
each release.

== Requirements ==

Mutagen
discogs-client - Packaged with DiscogsTagger 

== Installation ==

TODO

== Configuration ==

DiscogsTagger searches for the configuration file at the default location of
~/.discogs_tagger.conf, at run-time. Or you're able to specify the config 
location with the '-c' switch.

The configuration file must be present to execute the script. The default 
settings (as shipped), should work without any modifications.

== Examples ==

TODO

== Further TODOs == 
    - String comparison to determine similarities between local track-list, and
      the discogs API response. Options = Levenshtein or difflib..
    - clean-up install, or setup-tools..
    - Support for multiple cds/directories
