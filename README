== What ==

DiscogsTagger is a console based audio metadata tagger. Artist profile data is 
retrieved via the discogs.com API.

Simply provide the script with a destination directory name, that contains an
album consisting of either FLAC or MP3 media files, and the discogs.com 
release-id. DiscogsTagger calls out to the discogs.com API and updates the
audio metadata accordingly.

During the process, all album images (if present) are retreived from the API. 
As well, a playlist (.m3u) and an information file (.nfo) are generated per
each release.
